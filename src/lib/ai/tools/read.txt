Reads a file from the workspace filesystem. You can access any file within the project workspace using this tool.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter should be a path relative to the workspace root, or an absolute path within the workspace
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results include line numbers, total line count, and whether the file was truncated
- It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive an empty string
- Use this tool before editing files to understand their current content
